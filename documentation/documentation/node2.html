Code, Compilation, Dependencies, and Design Choices</A>
</H1>
The code is written in C++ to combine low-level optimization 
(memory storage, access to LAPACK routines) with high-level abstraction.
It has been most thoroughly tested on the Linux
operating system but it also compiles and runs on Mac and Windows.

<P>
We have tried to keep the dependencies on other codes minimal.
The <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen</a> library is very handy
and provides useful and efficient routines, e.g., for matrix exponentials,
so we make use of it at multiple places in the code. This dependency is 
harmless, as Eigen is &ldquo;header only&rdquo;, i.e. it does not require installation
beyond downloading the header files. However, there have been issues with 
matrix exponentiations in Eigen versions below 3.4, so it is strongly 
recommended to download the lates stable release.

<P>
The numerically most demanding part of ACE is the calculation of SVDs, 
for which LAPACK routines are available (optional), e.g., within the
<a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/math-kernel-library.html">Intel MKL</a>.
These routines provide 
some degree of parallelization and, according to a few tests, reduce the 
computation time typically by a factor of 2-5. Note, however, using LAPACK
routines, we have encountered instabilities for very small threshold values 
(<!-- MATH
 $\epsilon \ll 10^{-12}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.44ex; vertical-align: -0.20ex; " SRC="img42.svg"
 ALT="$\epsilon \ll 10^{-12}$"></SPAN>). 
Whether or not to use these routines is decided by the user at the compilation
stage.

<P>
On Linux or Mac, Makefiles can be used for the compilation and some tuning
can be done by command line arguments. For example, for the compiler to find
the Eigen library, please set the variable 
<SPAN  CLASS="texttt">EIGEN_HOME</SPAN> manually (only required for the compilation step)
in such a way that the file <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">$EIGEN_HOME/Eigen/Eigen</SPAN> exists.
If the variable is not set, the script will try the most common directory
<SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/usr/include/eigen3/</SPAN>, which is, e.g., the place where Eigen is 
installed on Ubuntu Linux by the command <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">sudo apt install libeigen3-dev</SPAN>.

<P>
If the MKL is installed on your system, the <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">MKLROOT</SPAN> 
environment variable should be set to the correct directory.
If this variable is set at the compilation stage, 
ACE will use the corresponding SVD routines.

<P>
To compile the code, set the corresponding environment variables, 
go into the main directory of ACE and type in the
console
<PRE>
&gt; make
</PRE>
This compiles the code and moves the binaries into the <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">bin/</SPAN>
subdirectory. For easy access later on, we suggest to add this directory
to your Linux environment via the <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">PATH</SPAN> variable. For example, 
add the follwing line to your <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.27ex; vertical-align: -0.11ex; " SRC="img43.svg"
 ALT="$\sim$"></SPAN>/.bashrc</SPAN> file 
<PRE>
PATH=/.../ACE/bin/:$PATH
</PRE>
where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 0.67ex; vertical-align: -0.11ex; " SRC="img44.svg"
 ALT="$\dots$"></SPAN> is to be replaced by the correct absolute path to the ACE 
directory. More programs, e.g., to post-process output data or manipulate
PT-MPOs stored in files, can be compiled by running &ldquo;<code>make tools</code>&rdquo; 
from the ACE
directory, which creates binaries in <code>/.../ACE/tools/</code>, which should then
also be added to the path: <code>PATH=/.../ACE/bin/:/.../ACE/tools/:$PATH</code>.

<P>
Log out and log in again to activate the changes. 
Then, go to a temporary directory and run
<PRE>
&gt; ACE
</PRE>
This should generate a file <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">ACE.out</SPAN> whose first lines are
<PRE>
0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0.01 0 0 1 0 0 0
0.02 0 0 1 0 0 0
0.03 0 0 1 0 0 0
0.04 0 0 1 0 0 0
...
</PRE>
Congratulations! You have just executed your first (rather boring) simulation
using ACE.

<P>
Compilation on Windows has been tested using the GCC compiler in
<a href="http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php">MinGW</a>. We provide a compile script 
with <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">compile.bat</SPAN> in the ACE directory. Please take a look and 
modify the path to the Eigen library according to your system specifics.
Alternatively, install 
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Windows Subsystem
for Linux (WSL)</a>.
