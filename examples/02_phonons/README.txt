General remark:
---------------

The generation of process tensors can take a while. In particular, the 
photon PT can take about one day and requires enough memory.

The iQUAPI calculations are fast but require lots of memory. 
Here, we suggest using a computer with 4GB RAM.


Note 1:    
-------

The examples '01_iQUAPI.param' and  '10_initial_iQUAPI.param' have to be run
with the program 'iQUAPI', not with 'ACE'


Note 2:
-------

Here, some examples ('02_calculate_phonon_PT.param', 
'03_calculate_photon_PT.param', and '06_calculate_photon_PT_BW0.4.param') 
are calculate and write process tensors to files.
Other examples read them and work with them. Thus, it is best to run the
examples in the correct order (according to the numbers in the file names).
